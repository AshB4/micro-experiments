📜 Dev Spellbook – Core Edition

🌿 Green Square Ritual – Dev Spellbook: Core Edition  
A manual of intention. A tool of quiet power.  
For the developer who commits with purpose — not panic.

⚙️ Tools Inside the Ritual Kit

- `daily-square.sh.x` — the sacred commit script  
- `schedual-ritual.sh.x` — a mischief-maker for randomized commit times  
- `core-ritual-setup.command` — the one-click executable blessing & GitHub linker  
- `notes/` — your prefilled code pages to ensure green square success  
- `logs/` — your digital grimoire of success and failure  
- `Core_Edition_README.md` — a no-fluff walkthrough (with vibes)  
- `Core-Manifest.txt` — what’s included, what’s forbidden

🔮 Performing the Ritual

1. Double-click `core-ritual-setup.command`  
   This will:
   - Ask for your GitHub username & repo
   - Make the commit script executable
   - Create your logs + sacred `.js` notes

2. Open Terminal and run:
   ./scripts/daily-square.sh.x

   This performs your daily commit ritual.
   If your offering is worthy (and your repo is set)... 
    You shall summon a green square...  
    The grid shall live another day.

✨ Ritual results are stored in `/logs/`, like margin notes in an arcane spellbook.

💡 Optional Enhancements

- Use `schedual-ritual.sh.x` to manifest randomized windows of contribution  
- Add a `cron` job only if you’re ready to automate intention  
- But remember: **the ritual works best when done on purpose** 🌙

🧘‍♂️ Why Core Exists

This is for devs who want the **power**, not the **noise**.  
You choose when to summon.  
You decide what gets pushed.  
You control the square.

The code obeys.  
The streak lives.  
The world need not know the magic behind your grid.

> “Discipline is the highest form of magic.  
> Your streak is sacred. Let no taskmaster claim it.” 🌿
