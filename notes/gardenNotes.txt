# 🌱 System Usage Notes
_Last updated: 2025-04-24 18:47:06_

This is your GitHub Green Square Ritual Automation system. Here's everything you need to know to check it, fix it, or run it manually.

---

## 🕒 Check if the Ritual is Scheduled for Today

Run:
```bash
atq
```

This will show you something like:
```
2	Fri Apr 25 09:52:00 2025
```
That means the daily ritual is scheduled to run at that time.

To see what exactly is scheduled:
```bash
at -c <job-number>
```
For example:
```bash
at -c 2
```

---

## 🛠️ Run the Ritual Manually (If Needed)

You can trigger the ritual manually any time:
```bash
bash ~/Desktop/micro-experiments/daily-square.sh
```

This will:
- Flip the repo to public
- Add a tiny commit
- Push to GitHub
- Flip the repo back to private
- Log everything in `cronlog.txt`

---

## 🧹 General Maintenance Checks

1. **Verify crontab is set:**
```bash
crontab -l
```
You should see something like:
```
0 7 * * 1-5 /bin/bash ~/Desktop/micro-experiments/daily.sh
```

2. **Check the daily log:**
```bash
cat ~/Desktop/micro-experiments/cronlog.txt
```

3. **Check for errors:**
```bash
cat ~/Desktop/micro-experiments/cronerror.txt
```

---

## 🔁 Reset / Restart

If anything ever seems off, you can safely re-run the setup:
```bash
bash ~/Downloads/ritual-setup.sh
```

It won't hurt anything — it’ll just refresh the scripts and logs.

Happy green squaring! 🌿
